# smart-agriculture
This was a group project for Nepal's biggest technological event LOCUS 17th National Technological Festivel . The project achieves automatic as well as manual ways of farming. The soil and environment condition is checked in real-time by the sensors and the microcontroller sends the data to firebase. Then, the data from firebase is retrieved by our android app  so that we can control and analyse accordingly
